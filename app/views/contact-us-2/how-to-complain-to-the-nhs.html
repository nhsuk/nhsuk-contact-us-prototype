          <p data-block-key="hkprm">You have the right to make a complaint about any aspect of NHS care, treatment or service, and this is written into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england">NHS Constitution on GOV.UK</a>.</p><p data-block-key="8hcbs">The information on this page will guide you through the NHS complaints process, as well as the core requirements for NHS complaints handling.</p><p data-block-key="a11r8">The NHS encourages feedback because it's used to improve services. If you wish to share your views and experiences, positive or negative, simply speak to a member of staff.</p><p data-block-key="acg9j">Many service providers have feedback forms available on their premises or websites. Sometimes the NHS will ask for your feedback.</p><p data-block-key="e5ii">If you're unhappy with an NHS service, it's often worthwhile discussing your concerns early on with the provider of the service, as they may be able to sort the issue out quickly.</p><p data-block-key="uuff">Most problems can be dealt with at this stage, but in some cases you may feel more comfortable speaking to someone not directly involved in your care.</p><h2 data-block-key="cl4k5">If you're considering making a complaint but need help</h2><p data-block-key="85cc3">Many issues can be resolved quickly by speaking directly to the staff at the place where you received care or accessed a service.</p><p data-block-key="bms21">Some people find it helpful to talk to someone who understands the complaints process first and get some guidance and support.</p><p data-block-key="fdhkd">The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/other-health-services/patient-advice-and-liaison-services-pals">Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS)</a> is a free, confidential and independent service that you'll find in most hospitals.</p><p data-block-key="2svc">You can speak with a PALS member, who'll try to help you resolve issues informally with the hospital before you need to make a complaint.</p><p data-block-key="eh45">PALS can be particularly helpful if your issue is urgent and you need action immediately, such as a problem with the treatment or care you receive while in hospital.</p><p data-block-key="ba8vr">If you're making, or thinking about making, a complaint, you could get help from an NHS complaints advocate.</p><p data-block-key="fdofg">An advocate can help you to write a complaint letter and attend meetings with you, but cannot make the complaint for you or give medical or legal advice.</p><p data-block-key="2jdqu">You can get advice from an NHS complaints advocate at any stage of the process. If you decide you need some support, it's never too late to ask for help.

You cannot apply to both.</p><p data-block-key="cu9c">In the event of a complaint about more than one organisation – perhaps a complaint that includes issues about your GP, local hospital and ambulance service – the organisations must co-operate with each other to make sure you get a co-ordinated response.</p><h3 data-block-key="9ilh7">How do I find the commissioner?</h3><p data-block-key="5fk7l">Contact your local integrated care board (ICB) for complaints about primary care services (GPs, dentists, opticians or pharmacists) and secondary care, such as hospital care, mental health services, out-of-hours services, NHS 111 and community services like district nursing.</p><p data-block-key="8itue">Every ICB will have its own complaints procedure, which is often displayed on its website.</p><p data-block-key="856ns"><a href="/nhs-services/find-your-local-integrated-care-board/">Find your local integrated care board (ICB)</a></p><p data-block-key="c06m3">Contact NHS England for complaints about healthcare in prison, military health services, and specialised services that support people with a range of rare and complex conditions.</p><p data-block-key="feucd"><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/contact-us/complaint/complaining-to-nhse/">Find out about complaining to NHS England</a></p><p data-block-key="fbu2v">Contact your local council if your complaint is about public health organisations, which provide services that prevent disease, promote health and prolong life.</p><p data-block-key="bjfj5"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Find your local council on GOV.UK</a></p><h3 data-block-key="ai7sj">Complaining about adult social care services</h3><p data-block-key="6it84">If you're unhappy with a social care service, care home or home care and you're paying for your own care, you may want to speak to the service provider first.</p><p data-block-key="46q97">But if you want to make a complaint, the organisations that provide these services will have their own complaints arrangements.</p><p data-block-key="51lc2">If your care is funded or arranged by your local council, you may wish to raise the issues with the care provider in the first instance.</p><p data-block-key="1j2pm">If you'd prefer not to do that, you can raise your concerns directly with your local council.</p><p data-block-key="u5ua"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">Find your local council on GOV.UK</a></p><h3 data-block-key="8gqbr">Complaining about the use of the Mental Health Act</h3><p data-block-key="bf1u0">If you wish to make a complaint about a mental health service, you should either contact the service provider or the local ICB.</p><p data-block-key="fqn83">But if you wish to complain about the use of the <a href="/mental-health/social-care-and-your-rights/mental-health-and-the-law/mental-health-act/">Mental Health Act</a> on someone detained in hospital or put on a guardianship or under a community treatment order, complain to the Care Quality Commission (CQC).</p><p data-block-key="5ho5u"><a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/contact-us/how-complain/complain-about-use-mental-health-act">Find out how to complain about the use of the Mental Health Act on the CQC website</a></p><h3 data-block-key="70t"><b>Complaining about care your child is receiving</b></h3><p data-block-key="38rfq">If you have concerns about the care your child is receiving, raise it with the team caring for your child.
